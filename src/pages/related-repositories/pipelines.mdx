# Extend, Build & Deploy Kabanero Pipelines
Developers that use [Kabanero](https://kabanero.io/) pipelines often times have to extend these pipelines to do certain tasks that do not come
in the out-of-the-box Kabanero pipelines. These tasks may include code coverage, or use third party applications like
[Pact Broker](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker), [Sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) or [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/)
to full-fill software requirements. Currently, there are not many methods to manage and version control your Kabanero 
pipelines, and the goal of this repository is to help you get going.

You will learn how to package, host your pipelines in different environments such as Git or Artifactory and use
these pipelines to automate the process of updating the [Kabanero custom resource](https://kabanero.io/docs/ref/general/configuration/kabanero-cr-config.html) 
to a respective host where your Kabanero pipelines exist.

# How to use artifactory-package-release-update pipeline
You can use this pipeline to package, release your pipelines onto Artifactory.

### Pre-reqs
- Fork the [devops-pipelines](https://github.com/ibm-garage-ref-storefront/devops-pipelines) repository
- Deploy [Artifactory](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/gse-devops/tree/master/cloudpak-for-integration-tekton-pipelines#artifactory) on your Openshift cluster

- Generate an [API Key](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/User+Profile). 
- Update Artifactory config map
[artifactory-config.yaml](./pipelines/stable/artifactory-package-release-update/configmaps/artifactory-config.yaml) and update the `artifactory_key`. Once done, run the following
commands:

      oc project kabanero
      cd ./configmaps
      oc apply -f artifactory-config.yaml
### Steps
1. Go to the [pipelines](./pipelines) directory make any modifications you want to do to any of the pipelines, or include your own.

2. Create your pipeline by running the following command:

        cd pipelines/experimental
        oc apply --recursive --filename pipelines/experminetal/artifactory-package-release-update/    
3. Go to the dashboard and verify that the `artifactory-package-release-update-pl` has been added to the Tekton dashboard

4. Go to section [Create tekton webhook](#create-a-tekton-webhook) to create your web hook.

5. Go to your forked repository and make a change, and your Tekton dashboard should create a 
new pipeline run as shown below:
![Artifactory Package Release Pipeline](../../images/artifactory-package-release-update-pl-rn.gif)
Where the `git-source` is defined as the pipeline resource with key [url] and value [github repo url] 

### Result
The end result should look like the following:

# How to use git-package-release-update pipeline
You can use a pipeline to automate the process of extending, packaging and releasing your pipelines via a Git Release. The process is very similar to the section above. 

### Pre-reqs
- Fork this repository [devops-pipelines](https://github.com/ibm-garage-ref-storefront/devops-pipelines)


### Steps
1. Add your custom pipelines or modify an existing one 
   If you inspect `./pipelines/` you can create a new folder for each new pipeline you have and follow a similar structure as below.

      echo pwd
      ./devops-pipelines/pipelines
      ├── experimental
      │   ├── README.md
      │   ├── abc
      │   │   ├── bindings
      │   │   │   ├── abc-pl-pullrequest-binding.yaml
      │   │   │   └── abc-pl-push-binding.yaml
      │   │   ├── configmaps
      │   │   │   └── abc-pl-configmap.yaml
      │   │   ├── pipelines
      │   │   │   └── abc-pl.yaml
      │   │   ├── secrets
      │   │   │   └── abc-pl-secret.yaml
      │   │   ├── tasks
      │   │   │   └── abc-task.yaml
      │   │   └── template
      │   │       └── abc-pl-template.yaml
      │   └── manifest.yaml
      ├── stable
      │   ├── README.md
      │   ├── cde
      │   │   ├── bindings
      │   │   │   ├── cde-pl-pullrequest-binding.yaml
      │   │   │   └── cde-pl-push-binding.yaml
      │   │   ├── configmaps
      │   │   │   └── cde-pl-configmap.yaml
      │   │   ├── pipelines
      │   │   │   └── cde-pl.yaml
      │   │   ├── secrets
      │   │   │   └── cde-pl-secret.yaml
      │   │   ├── tasks
      │   │   │   └── cde-task.yaml
      │   │   └── template
      │   │       └── cde-pl-template.yaml
      │   └── manifest.yaml

    
  **Pipelines in `expermental` do not get built.**

2. Now drag and drop your pipelines and tasks to any of these folders, 
     
3. You must update the `configmap` and `secret` we provided for you. But first, create another repository such as `devops-server`. In this repo `devops-server` you will be hosting your pipelines as Git releases. Do not forget to create a README.md file.

    Navigate to `pipelines/stable/git-package-release-update/configmaps` and update the `pipeline-server-configmap.yaml`

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
    name: pipeline-server-configmap
    namespace: kabanero
    data:
        repo_org: your-github-username-or-org
        repo_name: your-github-repo-where-you-will-host-pipelines
        image_registry_publish: 'false'
        kabanero_pipeline_id: pipeline-manager
    ```

    Update the secret in `pipelines/stable/git-package-release-update/secrets/`

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
        name: pipeline-server-git
        namespace: kabanero
        type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
    data:
        password: your-git-token-encoded
        username: your-git-username-encoded
    ```
    
    Now run the following command to be able to retrieve resources for the `kabanero-pipeline` service account.

    ```bash
    oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:kabanero:kabanero-pipeline
    ```
    
4. Create web hook for the `devops-pipelines` repository you created on step 1.

5. Deploy your pipeline, tasks, event bindings and trigger templates by running the following command in the `devops-pipelines` repo you created on step 1:

    ```bash
    oc apply --recursive --filename pipelines/stable/git-package-release-update
    git add .
    git commit -m "adding new pipelines..."
    git push
    ```
### Result
- Your output should be the following:
![Git Package Release Pipeline](../../images/git-package-release-update-pl-run.gif)

- If you go to the `devops-server` repo you created on step 2, you should see a new release with your zip files as shown below:
![Pipeline Server Release](../../images/pipelines-server-release.gif)

- Now inspect your Kabanero Custom Resource to ensure your `default-kabanero-pipelines.tar.gz` got added to the `pipelines` key value pair.

  ```bash
  oc get kabanero -o yaml
  ```

  ```yaml
  stacks:
      pipelines:
      - https:
          url: https://github.com/ibm-garage-ref-storefront/pipelines-server/releases/download/1.0/default-kabanero-pipelines.tar.gz
      id: pipeline-manager
      sha256: 8fe10018016e5059640b1a790afe2d6a1ff6c4f54bf3e7e4fa3fc0f82bb2207d
  ```

- The pipelines that you added to the `devops-pipelines` repository should now be visible on the tekton dashboard as shown below:
![](../../images/deploy-storefront-ms-to-openshift.png)
![](../../images/git-package-release-pl.png)  

Now you can reuse these pipelines across your organization! If your cluster comes down you now have a backup of your pipelines.

# Create a tekton webhook 
### Pre-reqs

You need to create an access token on the tekton dashboard or cli in the kabanero namespace.
Earlier you created a github token on the github dashboard. You will need to get that token or generate another one and 
paste it below.
![Access Token](/../../images/access-token.gif)

- Web hook Settings:
    ```
    Name: devops-demo-kabanero-pipelines
    Repistory-url: your forked repo url goes here
    Access Token: Token you generated previously
    ```

- Target Pipeline Settings
    ```
    Namespace: kabanero
    Pipeline: Choose artifactory-package-release-update-pl or git-package-release-update-pl
    Service Account: Pipeline
    Docker Registry: us.icr.io/project-name or docker.hub.io/projectname
    ```
