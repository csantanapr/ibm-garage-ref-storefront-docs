## Set Up databases for Storefront

*This project is part of the 'IBM Cloud Native Reference Architecture' suite, available at
http://cloudnativereference.dev*

This project will demonstrate how to deploy all the databases that are required by the storefront application. This will show you how to deploy MySQL, Elasticsearch, CouchDB, and MariaDB databases.

### Get the repo

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-ref-storefront/storefront-databases.git
cd storefront-databases
```

- Run the below command to deploy the databases on the openshift cluster where `storefront-dev` is the project name.

```bash
./setup_databases.sh storefront-dev
```

## Create an organization on Github

When you create a new organization from scratch, it doesn't have any repositories associated with it.

Github has information on how to create an organization. View the link below for the steps:

https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch
## Clone the storefront-repo-automator to run the script  

Go into the repository named **storefront-repo-automator** and clone the repository: 

https://github.com/ibm-garage-ref-storefront/storefront-repo-automator

Once you have cloned the repository, make sure you run the following command: 

``` shell
cd storefront-repo-automator
```

```shell
export org=[organization name]
export initials=[your initials]
./run.sh $org $initials
```
