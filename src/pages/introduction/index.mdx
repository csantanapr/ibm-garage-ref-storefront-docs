Get started with cloud-native by learning how to deploy a simple retail application, Storefront. The Storefront application implements a simple shopping application that displays a catalog of antique computing devices. People can search for and buy products from the application's web interface. You can use it as a starting point with a sample application.

As part of producing the IBM cloud-native point of view and reference architecture, we wanted to bring together a complete scenario which would cover all aspects of developing a cloud-native solution. We felt that the ecommerce business could provide a good foundation for this and would enable us to show how to develop cloud-native solutions following the architecture patterns.
